Let him blow it
let him play it
let him show his back

Let his lips sore
let them bleed now
blondes and brunettes

For how many
miles he'll walk to
find a place to rest?

And how many fights
he'll fight to
prove that he's the best?

It's the tombstone
of the milestones
or is it a throne?

Prince of darkness
it's so hard to
hear some better blow...

For how many keys
the Cs and Gs
he'll play along?

What is wrong?
What if his life was
nothing but a song?...
