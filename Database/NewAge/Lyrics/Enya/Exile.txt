Cold as the northern winds
in December mornings,
Cold is the cry that rings
from this far distand shore.

Winter has come too late
too close beside me.
How can I chase away
all these fears deep inside?

I'll wait the signs to come.
I'll find a way
I will wait the time to come.
I'll find a way home.

My light shall be the moon
and my path - the ocean.
My guide the morning star
as I sail home to you.

I'll wait the signs to come.
I'll find a way.
I will wait the time to come.
I'll find a way home.

Who then can warm my soul?
Who can quell my passion?
Out of these dreamsQa boat
I will sail home to you.
