I don't talk much I'm a quiet man
Beauty and silence both run deep
And I'm running like crazy while you are asleep

You got news for me, I got nothing for you
Don't pin your blues on me
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to

Last Monday night I saw a fight
Between Wednesday and Thursday over Saturday night
Tuesday asked me what was going on, I said
"Sunday's in the meadow and Friday's in the corn

You got news for me, I got nothing for you
Don't pin your blues on me
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to

Hocus-pocus, maladjusted
Don't you think my tears get rusted
