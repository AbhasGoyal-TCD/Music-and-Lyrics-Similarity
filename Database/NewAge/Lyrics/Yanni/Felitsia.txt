Inside a promise

winter has fallen
and summer has stolen
my heart unclaimed.
I have flown by
hours unnoticed
frozen without your embrace.

I've been dancing with you,

longing this hour
to send me into
loving surrender
the beauty i treasure
all that i see is still
only for you.
Love me,
release me,
say that you'll keep me
dancing forever with you


Open the window
let in the starlight,
don't wait for tomorrow
it's perfect tonight.
Hold me,
here for
just a while longer
where no lonely heart ever breaks.

I've been dancing with you

longing this hour

to send me into
loving surrender
the beauty i treasure
all that i see is still
only for you.

Love me,
release me,
say that you'll keep me
dancing forever with you.

Hold me,
heal me,
your eyes reveal me
and i will not give that away.

I've been dancing with you,
needing this hour

to send me into
loving surrender
the beauty i treasure
all that i see is still
only for you.

Love me,
release me,
say that you'll keep me
dancing forever with you.

And it's like a forgiving sky,

like every chance i find
here where a promise starts,
here in your giving arms.
I pray that you'll keep my heart..
