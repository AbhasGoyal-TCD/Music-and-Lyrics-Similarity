Sometimes I will, then again I think I won't
Sometimes I will, then again I think I won't
Sometimes I do, then again I think I don't
Well, I looked at my watch, it was 9:21
Without a rock 'n' roll dance, havin' nothin' but fun
And we rolled, reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin', and rollin' 'til the break of dawn
Well, I looked at my watch, it was 9:32
There's nothin' I'd rather do than dance with you
And we rolled, reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin' way 'til the break of dawn
Well, I looked at my watch, it was 9:43
And every time I'd spin, she'd spin with me
We reeled, reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin', and rollin' 'til the break of dawn
Well, I looked at my watch, it was 9:54
I said, "Dance ballerina girl, go, go, go go"
And we go, reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin', and rollin' 'til the break of dawn
Well, I looked at my watch, it was 10:05
Man, I didn't know whether I was dead or alive
But I was rolled, reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin', and rollin' 'til the break of dawn
Well, I looked at my watch, it was 10:26
But I'ma keep on dancin' 'til I got my kicks
We were reelin', reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin', and rollin' 'til the break of dawn
Well, I looked at my watch, it was 10:28
I gotta get my kicks 'fore it gets too late
We were reelin', reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin', and rollin' 'til the break of dawn
Well, I looked at my watch, it was 10:29
I had to hold her hand, she was still holdin' mine
We were reelin', reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin', and rollin' 'til the break of dawn
Well, I looked at my watch, and to my surprise
I was dancin' with a woman that was twice my size
We were reelin', reelin' and rockin'
I was reelin' and rockin', and rollin' 'til the break of dawn
Well, I looked at my watch, and it was time to go
The band leader said, "We ain't playin' no mo'"
We were reelin', reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin' way 'til the break of dawn
