Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started doing the things you used to do
As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coup√© de Ville
A Cadillac a-rollin on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V-8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' 'bout 95
She bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doin' the things you used to do
The Cadillac pulled up at 104
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It done got cloudy and started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water blowin' all under my hood
I knew that wasn't doin' my motor good
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doin' the things you used to do
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doin' the things you used to do
The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
Cadillac sittin' like toad on a lake
A 110, a half mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doin' the things you used to do
