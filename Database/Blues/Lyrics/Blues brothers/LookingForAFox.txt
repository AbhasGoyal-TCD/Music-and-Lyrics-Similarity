I'm all alone and fancy free
Oh, but that ain't the way I want be
Now girls get your game up tight
We're gonna have a wing, ding doodle tonight
But right now
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
Tonight the sky's the limit
I got some money and I wanna spend it
It's Saturday night and I wanna play
I'm gonna groove till the break of day
Now look a here
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
Got a brand new pin stripe suit of clothes
Big wide polka-dot tie
Cuff links as big as J-bird eggs
And look at that shoes made out of alligator hide
Well say something else here
I'm ripe and ready and hot to trot
Boy you on fire
Girl you can get everything I got
He'll take it too
I got got the money if got the time
We open all night
All you gotta do is gimme a sign
Look a hear
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
Hey Mac, you know something?
You can sing man
Looking for a fox
Looking for a fox
Looking for a fox

Looking for a fox
Looking for a fox
Looking for a fox
Looking for a fox
Looking for a fox
