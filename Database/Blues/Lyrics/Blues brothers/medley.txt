You better think think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think let your mind go, let yourself be free
Let's go back, let's go back, let's go way on back when
I didn't even know you, you couldn't have been too much more than ten
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with a degree
It don't take too much high IQ's to see what you're doing to me
Oh think, think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think, let your mind go, let yourself be free
Oh freedom, freedom, freedom, yeah freedom
Freedom, freedom, give me freedom, I need freedom

I was gonna change, but I'm not, to keep doing things I don't
Hey think, think about what you're trying to do to me
Baby, think, let your mind go, let yourself be free
People walking around everyday, playing games that they can score
Trying to make other people lose their minds,
Be careful you don't lose yours
Yeah think, think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let your mind go, let yourself be free
Oh freedom, freedom, freedom, yeah freedom
Freedom, freedom, give me freedom, I need freedom
I want you!
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Someone to love
Sweetheart to miss
Sugar to kiss
I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you you you
In the morning
When my soul's on fire
Sometimes I feel
I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me
I never never never find a place to hide
I need you
Sometimes I feel
I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me
I never never never find a place to hide
I need you you you
I need you you you
I want you you you
I want you you you in the morning
When the sun comes down
Everybody
I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you.
