Hey!
Well my temperature's rising and my feet on the floor
Twenty people rockin' and there wanna go more
Let me in baby, I don't know what you've got
But you'd better take it easy, this place is hot
So glad we made it
So glad we made it
You gotta gimme some lovin'
(Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin'
(Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin'
Everyday
Hey!
Well I feel so good, everything is sellin' high
You'd better take it ease 'cause the place is on fire
It's been a hard day and I don't know what to do
Wait a minute baby; can it happen to you?
So glad we made it
So glad we made it
You gotta gimme some lovin'
(Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin'
(Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin'
Everyday
Hey
Well I feel so good, everybody's getting' high
You'd better take it easy cause the place is on fire
It's been a hard day, doesn't feel too good
Now I'm gonna relax, honey, everybody should
So glad we made it
(Hey, hey)
So glad we made it
You gotta gimme some lovin'
