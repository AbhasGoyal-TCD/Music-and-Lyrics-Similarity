The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty
Well, I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock n roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothings gonna stop us, no nothing
So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you got the dollar, we got the song
Just wanna boogie woogie all night long
Yeah, boogie
I got holes in my shoes
I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million
And I got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well, they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean
But I've got a momma whose a hummer
She's keeping me alive
While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys
She's working 9 to 5
She knows her place, that woman
Just you wait
One of these days see me driving round town
In my rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
My bottle of booze
No summer time blues
Shouting out, "Look at me"
In my rock n roll voice
There ain't no fun ', yeah
Waiting 'round to be a millionaire
There ain't no fun, oh
Waiting 'round to be a millionaire
Do you believe me?
There ain't no fun, no
Waiting 'round to be a millionaire
There ain't no fun
Waiting 'round to be a millionaire
No, there ain't no fun, boy
Waiting 'round to be a millionaire
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, ain't no fun
Waiting 'round to be a millionaire
Hey, hello Howard, how you doin, my next door neighbour?
Oh yea... Get your fuckin jumbo jet off my airport
