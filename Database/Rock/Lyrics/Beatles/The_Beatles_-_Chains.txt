Chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Whoa, these chains of love
Got a hold on me, yeah
Chains
Well, I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around
'Cause I'm not free
Whoa, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah
I want to tell you, pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But Darling, I'm imprisoned by these
Chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Please believe me when I tell you
Your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these
Chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains
Chains of love
Chains of love
Chains of love
