This, is, how, we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This, is, how, we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
Fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Chrome hydraulics, 808, drums
You don't want, none, nigga betta, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, trunk
Come get, some, pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
It's red-red, rum, ready here I, come
Compton, uhh, Dre found me in the, slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin', "Uhhh"
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
Coke and rum, got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like, uhh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna, stunt
I put Lamborghini doors on that Escolade
Low pro so look like I'm ridin' on blades
In one year man, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (Ahh!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Tre pound on my hip, teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good 'cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'Cause shit might pop off, and when shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass
This, is, how, we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This, is, how, we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club

I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm ridin' on bulbs
Hit one switch mayne, that ass so low
Cali' got niggas in New York ridin' on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best
Four pound on my hip, gold chain on my chest (Ahh!)
50, uhh, Bentley, uhh
Em' came and got a nigga fresh out the, slum
Automatic, gun, fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt and ya done
Homie, it's Game time, you ready? Here it come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months but Fifty got it done
Signed with G-unit had niggas like, "Huh?"
Don't try to front, I'll leave yo' ass, slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk get your fuckin' head, lumped
Fifty got a gun, ready? Here it come
Gotta sick, vendetta to get this, cheddar
Meet my Be-retta, the drama, setter
Sip Ama-retta, my flow sounds, better
Than average, on tracks I'm a savage, I damage
Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique (G-Unit)
