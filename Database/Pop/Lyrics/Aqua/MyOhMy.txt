My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To have their kingdom, baby, tell me why
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To rule a country, baby, you and I
If you were my king
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To have their kingdom, baby, tell me why
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To rule a country, baby, you and I
A little princess in a terrible mess
A kingdom alone with no lover's confess
Dreams of a prince on a tall white horse
Runs like a spirit by the castle walls
Gotta steal from the rich
When they don't know I'm coming
Gotta give to the poor
No time for lovin'
My oh my, don't you cry
'Cause there's no way I'm staying
I will leave, say bye-bye
I'm going my way
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To have their kingdom, baby, tell me why
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To rule a country, baby, you and I
If you were my king, oh whoa
I will be your queen, oh whoa
If you were my king, oh whoa
I will be your queen, oh whoa
Mystery deep in the royal heart
Crying at night, I wanna be a part
Prince, oh prince, are you really sincere
That you one day are gonna disappear
Gotta steal from the rich
When they don't know I'm coming
Gotta give to the poor
No time for lovin'
My oh my, don't you cry
'Cause there's no way I'm staying
I will leave, say bye-bye
I'm going my way
My oh my, ooh whoa
My oh my, ooh whoa
My oh my, ooh whoa
My oh my
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To have their kingdom, baby, tell me why
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To rule a country, baby, you and I
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To have their kingdom, baby, tell me why
My oh my, do you wanna say goodbye
To rule a country, baby, you and I
If you were my king, oh whoa
I will be your queen, oh whoa
If you were my king, oh whoa
I will be your queen, oh whoa
