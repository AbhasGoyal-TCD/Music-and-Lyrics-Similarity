I am the candyman
(Oh) Coming from bounty land
(Oh) I am the candyman
(Oh) Coming from bounty land
I wish that you were my lollipop
Sweet things, I will never get enough
If you show me to the sugar tree
Will you give me a soda pop for free
Come with me, honey
I'm your sweet sugar candyman
Run like the wind
Fly with me to bounty land
Bite me, I'm yours
If you're hungry, please understand
This is the end of
The sweet sugar candyman
Oh my love, I know you are my candyman
And oh my love, your word is my command
Oh my love, I know you are my candyman
And oh my love, let us fly to bounty land
You are my lollipop
(Oh) Sugar sugar top
(Oh) You are my lollipop
(Oh) Sugar sugar top
I wish that I were a bubblegum
Chewing on me baby, all day long
I will be begging for sweet delight
Until you say I am yours tonight
Come with me, honey
I'm your sweet sugar candyman
Run like the wind
Fly with me to bounty land
Bite me, I'm yours
If you're hungry, please understand
This is the end of
The sweet sugar candyman
Oh my love, I know you are my candyman
And oh my love, your word is my command
Oh my love, I know you are my candyman
And oh my love, let us fly to bounty land
Oh my love, I know you are my candyman
And oh my love, your word is my command
Oh my love, I know you are my candyman
And oh my love, let us fly to bounty land
I am the candyman
Coming from bounty land
I am the candyman
Coming from bounty land
Coming from bounty land
Oh my love, I know you are my candyman
And oh my love, your word is my command
Oh my love, I know you are my candyman
And oh my love, let us fly to bounty land
You are my lollipop
(Oh) Sugar sugar top
(Oh) You are my lollipop
(Oh) Sugar sugar top
