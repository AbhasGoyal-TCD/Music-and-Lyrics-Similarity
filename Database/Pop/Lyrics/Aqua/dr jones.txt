Sometimes, the feeling is right
You fall in love for the first time
Heartbeat, and kisses so sweet
Summer time love in the moonlight


I yipi I ooh, I yipi I eh, I yipi I ooh ahh


Now the summer is gone
You have to go back home
Please come and see me again
I never felt more alone


Baby, I'm missing you
I want you by my side
And I hope you miss me too
Come back and stay
I think about you every day
I really want you too
You swept my feet
Right off the ground
You're the love I found

Doctor Jones, Jones
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Get up now
Wake up now

Doctor Jones, Jones
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Wake up now
Wake up now


I yipi I ooh, I yipi I eh, I yipi I ooh ahh
I yipi I ooh, I yipi I eh, I yipi I ooh ahh


All I think of is you
And all of the things we had
Doctor, what can I do?
Why does it have to be like that?


Baby, I'm missing you
I want you by my side
And I hope you'll miss me too
Come back and stay
I think about you every day
I really want you to
You swept my feet
Right off the ground
You're the love I found

Doctor Jones, Jones

Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Get up now

Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Wake up now

Please, please, cure me
Please, please, cure me
Please, please, cure me
Please, please, cure me


Doctor Jones, Jones
