When the sun is up
On a clear blue sky
You will act like a lover
When the sky is gray
And the rain comes down
You will run for cover
Feel the heat, come out of cold
And your arm is touching me
Good morning sunshine, you're my only light
Lying with me by my side
You keep me warm all day just stay with me
Good morning sunshine, be with me all day
Just don't let the rain pass you by
When it's cloudy or windy
And the snowflakes arrive
You somehow just make me
Make me feel I'm alive
When you leave my field
Then you're like the stars
Fading away in the horizon
There's a million streets
Leading off the night
Waiting for sun to be rising
Feel the heat, come out of cold
And your arm is touching me
Good morning sunshine, you're my only light
Lying with me by my side
You keep me warm all day just stay with me
Good morning sunshine, be with me all day
Just don't let the rain pass you by
When it's cloudy or windy
And the snowflakes arrive
You somehow just make me
Make me feel I'm alive
Hold it right there
Let me take a minute of your time
To explain how I feel
Through these rhymes
I do the best I can
And believe me if I could
I'll build you a paradise
With these two hands
The top of your skin
Makes my body go numb
I'm thinking to myself
If my dreams come true or is it
'Cause you never give me a chance
To tell you how I feel
The moments we had
Were too precious to kill
When it's cloudy or windy
Please turn your face at me
Good morning sunshine, you're my only light
Lying with me by my side
You keep me warm all day just stay with me
Good morning sunshine, be with me all day
Just don't let the rain pass you by
When it's cloudy or windy
And the snowflakes arrive
You somehow just make me
Make me feel I'm alive
Make me feel I'm alive
