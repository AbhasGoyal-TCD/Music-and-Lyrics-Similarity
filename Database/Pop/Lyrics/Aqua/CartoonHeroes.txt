We are what we're supposed to be
Illusions of your fantasy
All dots and lines that speak and say
What we do is what you wish to do
We are the color symphony
We do the things you wanna see
Frame by frame to the extreme
Our friends are so unreasonable
They do the unpredictable
All dots and lines that speak and say
What we do is what you wish to do
It's all an orchestra of strings
Doing unbelievable things
Frame by frame to the extreme
One by one we're making it fun
We are the cartoon heroes, oh whoa
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
We came out of a crazy mind, oh whoa
And walked out on a piece of paper
Here comes Spider-Man, Arachnophobian
Welcome to the toon town party
Here comes Superman from never, never land
Welcome to the toon town party
We learn to run at speed of light
And to fall down from any height
It's true but just remember that
What we do is what you just can't do
An opera of craziness
A bunch of dots that's chasing us
Frame by frame to the extreme
One by one we're making it fun
We are the cartoon heroes, oh whoa
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
We came out of a crazy mind, oh whoa
And walked out on a piece of paper
Here comes Spider-Man, Arachnophobian
Welcome to the toon town party
Here comes Superman from never, never land
Welcome to the toon town party
You think we're so mysterious
Don't take us all too serious
Be original and remember that
What we do is what you just can't do
What we do is what you just can't do
What we do is what you just can't do
What we do is what you just can't do
What we do is what you just can't do
We are the cartoon heroes, oh whoa
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
We came out of a crazy mind, oh whoa
And walked out on a piece of paper
There's still more to come, and everyone will be
Welcomed at the toon, toon, town, town, party
