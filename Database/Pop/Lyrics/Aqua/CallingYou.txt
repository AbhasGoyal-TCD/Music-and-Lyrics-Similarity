C-A-L-L-I-N-G, now I'm calling you
Calling you now
C-A-L-L-I-N-G, now I'm calling you
Calling you now, oh
I-I-I can't get my message through
Why-y-y don't you pick up the phone
All my love is running down the line
But you won't receive it, no, no
I-I-I will whisper sweet words
And cry-y-y if you tell me the same
What I hear is just the old, lame
Occupied signal tone
Operator, all you have to do
Is connect me, I am waiting for it
Help me, I am waiting to be
C-A-L-L-I-N-G, now I'm calling you
Calling you now
C-A-L-L-I-N-G, now I'm calling you
Calling you now, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I-I-I call you once again
And I-I-I resist to give in
Now my love is running down the drain
But you won't receive it, no, no
I-I-I will whisper sweet words
And cry-y-y if you tell me the same
What I hear is just the old, lame
Occupied signal tone
Operator, all you have to do
Is connect me, I am waiting for it
Help me, I am waiting to be
C-A-L-L-I-N-G, now I'm calling you
Calling you now
C-A-L-L-I-N-G, now I'm calling you
Calling you now, oh
I-I-I, operator
I-I-I, operator
I-I-I, operator
I-I-I, operator
C-A-L-L-I-N-G, now I'm calling you
Calling you now
C-A-L-L-I-N-G, now I'm calling you
Calling you now, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
