Ay, this morning I woke up in a curfew
Oh God, I was a prisoner, too
Could not recognize the faces standing over me
All dressed in uniforms of brutality
How many rivers do we have to cross
Before we can talk to the boss?
All we got, it seems we have lost
We must have really paid the cost
That's why we gonna be
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight, oh
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
Burnin' all pollution tonight
Oh we're burnin' all illusion tonight (ay)
Oh give me the food and let me grow
Let the Roots Man take a blow
I say there's all them drugs gonna make you slow now
It's not the music from the ghetto, ay
Weeping and a-wailin' tonight
Weeping and a-wailin' tonight
(Lord, Lord, Lord, ay!)
Weeping and a-wailin' tonight (uh)
Weeping and a-wailin' tonight (yeah)
How many rivers do we have to cross
Talk to the boss?
And we want more, if only that we have lost (know what I mean?)
We must have really paid the cost
That's why we gonna be
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight (burnin' and lootin')
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight (oh Lord, Lord, yeah)
Burnin' all pollution tonight (oh)
Burnin' all illusion tonight (ay)
Weeping and a-wailin' tonight
Weeping and a-wailin' tonight
Weeping and a-wailin' tonight (ooh can't stop the tears tonight)
Weeping and a-wailin' tonight (stop praying on our knees tonight, ay)
