No sun will shine in my day today
(No sun will shine)
The high yellow moon won't come out to play
(Won't come out to play)
Darkness has covered my light
(And the stage) and the stage my day into night
Now, where is this love to be found?
Won't someone tell me 'cause life (sweet life)
Must be somewhere (sweet life) to be found (somewhere, somewhere for me)
Instead of a concrete jungle
Where the living is harder (in a concrete)
Concrete jungle (jungle)
Oh man, you've got to do your best, yeah
No chains around my feet but I'm not free
I know I am bound here in captivity
And I've never known happiness
And I've never known sweet caresses
Still, I be always laughing like a clown
Won't someone help me 'cause I (sweet life)
I've got to pick myself (sweet life) from off the ground, yeah (somewhere, somewhere for me)
In this here concrete jungle (la la-la)
I say, what do you got for me, now?
Concrete jungle (la la-la)
Oh, why won't you let me be, now? (concrete jungle)
I said that life (sweet life)
Must be somewhere (sweet life) to be found, yeah, yeah (somewhere, somewhere for me)
Instead of a concrete jungle (jungle)
Where the living is hardest (concrete jungle)
Concrete jungle (jungle)
Oh man, you've got to do your best, yeah (concrete jungle)
Concrete jungle (jungle)
You name it
In this concrete jungle
(Jungle, jungle)
Concrete jungle, you name it, we got it
Concrete jungle, now
(Jungle, jungle, now)
