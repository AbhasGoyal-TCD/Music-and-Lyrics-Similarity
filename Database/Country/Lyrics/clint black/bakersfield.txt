Well I got on in Bristol, by the old Virgina line
With a suitcase full of dreams, and a brand new spendin' dime
I had a full bouquet of music, wrapped in pretty words
Singin' songs sent down from heaven, on the wings of a speckled bird
Wings of a speckled bird
I heard a guitar and a fiddle, banjo and mandolin
An old man opened up the door and told me "come on in"
He took my ticket, then he told me, bring what it is you do
'Cause that's how you'll be remembered when your travelin' days are through
When your travelin' days are through
They came from the hills and mountains, the valleys and the plains
Some were kind and gentle, and some too wild to tame
A string of fearless hearts, on an endless ball of twine
It's the same old train, it's just a different time
Just a different time
We sung songs in war, we sung songs in peace
We traveled in abundance and we traveled on relief
From the outer gates of heaven, to hell fire's burnin' door
It don't matter where you take it, 'cause it's been there before
It's been there before
They came from the hills and mountains, the valleys and the plains
Some were kind and gentle, and some too wild to tame
A string of fearless hearts, on an endless ball of twine
It's the same old train, it's just a different time
Just a different time
Now like a precious treasure, that's immeasurable in worth
We stand before a new wave, proud children of the earth
We'll go on forever, and here's your solid proof
As long as there's a world we've gotta sing those folks the truth
Sing those folks the truth
They came from the neon cities, the suburbs and the towns
From Bakersfield to Baltimore, its sacred holy ground
A string of fearless hearts, on an endless ball of twine
It's the same old train, it's just a different time (different time)
Just a different time (different time)
Just a different time (different time)
Just a different time
It's the same old train, it's just a different time
Same old train, just a different time
