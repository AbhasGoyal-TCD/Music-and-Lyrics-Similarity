Send me the pillow that you dream on
Don't you know that I still care for you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
Each night while I'm sleeping oh, so lonely
I pray that time will let our dreams come true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
Each night when I sleep I dream about you
And wish that I was dreamin' next to you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
Send me the pillow you dream on
(Send me the pillow, send me the pillow)
Send me, send me, send me the pillow that you dream on
(Send me the pillow, send me the pillow).
