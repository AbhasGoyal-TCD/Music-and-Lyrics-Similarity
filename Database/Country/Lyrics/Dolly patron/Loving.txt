If you've been wondering what I'm gonna do
While you are sleeping, am I sleeping too?
Well, I'm just sitting here loving you
Close my eyes and loving you
I'm just sitting back, sitting here loving you
I have been wondering just what I would do
If I weren't sleeping, had I not found you
Well, I'd be outside findin' you
I'd be walking on the avenue finding you
Well, I'm just sitting back, sitting here loving you
Now the reason that you never see me running 'round
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
And he can't even get me up and on my feet
When I've got to take care of some business on the street
I have been walking all my streets alone
But I won't keep walkin' to keep from going home
I couldn't quite barely conceive of you
Now I can conceive ever leaving you
Oh, an' I'm just sitting back, sitting here loving you
If you've been wondering what I'm gonna do
While you are sleeping, am I sleeping too?
Well, I'm just sitting here loving you
I just close my eyes and loving you
Oh, an' I'm just sitting back, sitting here loving you
