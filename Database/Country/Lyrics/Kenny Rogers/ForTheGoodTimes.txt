Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world just keeps on turning

Let's just be glad, we had this time
To spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning.

Lay your head on my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body next to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Beating soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times.

I get along you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find
You ever need me.

Don't say a word
About tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough
For sadness when you leave.

Lay your head on my pillow
