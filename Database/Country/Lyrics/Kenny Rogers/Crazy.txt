Girl, there are no words to say
What I feel in my heart
You, you're on my mind night and day
And it hurts me when we're apart
When you're not here by my side
There is nothing in this world for me.

I guess I'm crazy
Crazy for you can't you see
Although you may think it's crazy
Here it's where I want to be
I will always need your love.

Well now, I can see every dream
When I look in your eyes
And though, things never are what they seem
There is one thing that I realize
That there's no doubt in my mind
We can make this love go on forever.

I guess I'm crazy
Crazy for you can't you see
Although you may think it's crazy
Here it's where I'll always be
And I need you with me

Cos you are the dream
That finally came true in me
In all my life there'll be no one else
If I looked all my life
There could be no one else
And for the rest of my life
All I need is you.
