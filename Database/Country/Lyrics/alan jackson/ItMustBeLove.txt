First I get cold then hot
Think I'm on fire I'm not
Oh what a pain I've got it must be love
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm going through it must be love
It must be love it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I've been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin' it must be love
Something is wrong alright
I think of you all night
Can't sleep 'till mornin' light it must be love
Seein' you in my dreams
Holdin' you close to me
Oh what else can it be it must be love
It must be love it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I've been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin' it must be love
It must be love it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I've been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin' it must be love
It must be love it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I've been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin' it must be love
It must be love it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I've been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin' it must be love
It must be love it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I've been dreamin' of
