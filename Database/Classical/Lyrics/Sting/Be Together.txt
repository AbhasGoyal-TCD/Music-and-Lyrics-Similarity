I, I see me with you and all the things you do
Keep turning round and round in my mind
Forget the weather, we should always be together
Any other thought is unkind
To have you with me, I would swim the seven seas
I need you as my guide and my light
My love is a flame that burns in your name
We'll be together, we'll be together tonight (together)
We'll be together, yeah (together)
We'll be together, yeah (together)
We'll be together, yeah (together)
I, I see you with me and all I want to be
Is dancing here with you in my arms
Forget the weather, we should always be together
I'll always be a slave to your charms
To have you with me, I would swim the seven seas
I need you as my guide in my life
My love is a flame that burns in your name
We'll be together, we'll be together tonight (together)
We'll be together, yeah (together)
We'll be together, yeah (together)
We'll be together, yeah (together)
Call me baby
You can call me anything you want
Call me baby
Call me
Call me
I see you with me and baby makes three
I see me with you and all the things you do
Forget the weather, we should always be together
I need you as my guide and my light
My love is the flame that burns in your name
We'll be together, we'll be together tonight (together)
We'll be together, yeah (together)
(Together) we'll be together
