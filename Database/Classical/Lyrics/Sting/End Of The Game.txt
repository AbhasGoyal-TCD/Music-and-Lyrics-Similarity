I wrote this song about a pair of foxes
A male and female
It's about the end of their lives and it's about their relationship
It's called, "The end of the game" thank you
The fox is done running
And the beast is at bay
He'd run them in circles
By the end of the day
And they chased him through the brambles
And they chased him through the fields
And they could chase him forever
But the fox would not yield
And some saw her shadow
On the crest of a hill
And the hounds were distracted
Away from the kill
One day we'll reach a great ocean
At the end of a pale afternoon
And we lay down our heads just like we were sleeping
Controlled by the drag of the moon
We ran through the forests
And we ran through the streams
We ran through the heather
Though we ran in our dreams
And you were my lover
And I was your beau
We ran like the river
For else did we know?
One day we'll reach a great ocean
At the end of a pale afternoon
And the dogs are all worn out
And the horses all lame
Oh the hunters they're hunted
At the end of the game
Our love was a river
A wild mountain stream
In a tumbling fury
On the edge of a dream
And they chased us through the brambles
And they chased us through the fields
They'd chased us forever
But the heart would not yield
When the fox has done running
At the end of the day
I'm ready to answer
I'm ready to pay
And this river's done running
And my time will come soon
Carried to the great ocean
By the drag of the moon
