Nothing seemed to matter any more,
Didn't care what I was headed for.
Time was standing still,
No one counted till
There came a knocking at the door.
Love walked right in and drove the shadows away,
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day.
One magic moment, and my heart seemed to know
That love said Hello!
Though no a word was spoken.
One look and I forgot the gloom of the past,
One look and I had found my future at last.
One look and I had found a world completely new,
When love walked in, with you.
