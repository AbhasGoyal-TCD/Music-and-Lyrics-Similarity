Listen to my tale of woe
It's terribly sad, but true
All dressed up, no place to go
Each ev'ning I'm awfully blue
I know I'm a winsome miss I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
With somebody just like you. So...
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awf'ly misunderstood
So lady, be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good to me
(bis)
Oh lady be good to me
