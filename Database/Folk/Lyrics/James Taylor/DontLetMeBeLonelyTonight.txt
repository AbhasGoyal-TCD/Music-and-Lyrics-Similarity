Do me wrong
Do me right
Tell me lies, but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
Say goodbye and say hello
Sure it's good to see you and it's time to go
Don't say "Yes", but please don't say "No"
I don't want to be lonely tonight
Go away then, damn you
Go on and do as you please
Darling, you ain't gonna see me gettin' down on my knees
I'm undecided and yes, and your heart it's been divided
You've been turning my world upside down you know, know
So do me wrong, but do me right, right now baby
Go on and tell me lies, but hold me tight
And save your goodbyes for the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
I don't wanna
No
Please don't let be lonely
I don't wanna be lonely tonight
I don't wanna be lonely tonight
No, no
