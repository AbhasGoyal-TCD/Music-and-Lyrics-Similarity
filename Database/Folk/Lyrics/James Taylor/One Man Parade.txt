Do believe I'm gonna clap my hands, I think I might tap my feet
Put together a one-man band, take a walk on down the street
Have a one-man parade, nobody needs to know
'Cause I'm right good at holding on to secrets, and don't believe they show
All I want is a little dog to be walking at my right hand
Take in a breeze just as free as you please
Maybe checking out occasional garbage cans
Talking about a one-man dog, y'all, nobody's friend but mine
Hey now, you can say that he's looking kind of funky
But I do believe he suits me just fine
We were on the road again, I was wondering what to do
But Honalei, it was pouring down rain
Baby, she had the low down blues
Hey now (hey now) I was looking for my walking cane
Tying on my highway shoes
Thinking 'bout a one man parade, y'all
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, hey
I'm right good at holding on, holding on, holding on
listen here
(Honalei) it rains (it's raining) buckets
(Honalei) road is covered in muddy water (it's raining)
Talkin' 'bout a one man parade, y'all
And nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, hey
I'm right good at holding on, holding on, holding on
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh now nobody, nobody, nobody
La-la-la-la, yeah baby
No, no
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
