Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way lately, I've been lonesome
Blossom, it's been much too long a day
Seems my dreams have frozen, melt my cares away
Send the sunshine down my way whenever you call my name
I know what you mean to say to me, girl, it's all the same
Blossom, there's any empty road behind, sit you down beside me
Blossom, there's a sweet dream on my mind
There's a song inside me, take these chains away
Now, send the sunshine down my way whenever you call my name
I know what you mean to say to me, girl, it's all the same
Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way lately, I've been lonesome
Blossom, it's been much too long a day
Seems my dreams have frozen, melt my cares away
