When I walk along your city streets
And look into your eyes
When I see that simple sadness
Across your future lies
Now if my spirit starts to sink
It comes as no surprise
'Cause I've come a long way from anywhere
Like heaven to this town
There's a pasture in the countryside
I used to call my own
And there is a natural pillow for my head
The grass there is overgrown, yes I know
I think of that place from time to time
When I want to be alone
'Cause I've come a long way from anywhere
Like heaven to this town
Oh people they live from day to day
But they do not count the time
They don't see the days slipping by and neither do I
When I walk along your city streets
And look into your eyes
And when I see that simple sadness
That across your features lies, I can see lies
If my spirit starts to sink
It comes as no surprise
I've come a long way from anywhere
Like heaven to this town, your town
I was talking to
This is another song
This song was written in Mexico, it was named after Mexico
I can't pretend that it's really about Mexico in any real sense
'Cause I just spent about three days down there
But sort of like, yeah like a postcard, hey, where you going?
Are you the guy record company sent around?
Thanks, it's sort of a hippy's, you know
Hippy's view, my own view of going to Mexico
