Well everybody's building that boats
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes
Well everybody's in despair, every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna jump for joy
Oh come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Oh you know I like to do just like the rest you know I like my sugar sweet
But jumping fumes and making haste you know it ain't my a cup of meat
Well everybody's out there feeding a pigeons all under the limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here the pigeons gonna run to him
Oh come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.
A cat's meow and a cow's moo to you know I, I could recite them all
Tell me where it hurts you, honey and I'll tell you who to call
Nobody can get asleep, there's someone on everybody's toes
Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna want to doze
Oh come all without yeah, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Oh come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
